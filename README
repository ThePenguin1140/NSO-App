MyNSO 2013 OutlineThe purpose of this application is to provide new students to the University of Prince Edward Island an application that organizes their new experience, focusing on the New Student Orientation. The first days of university can be a very challenging, overwhelming, and stressful experience. This application aims to encourage students to get active in the NSO experience, provide an interface for students to remain organized, and to simply get their year started off on the right foot.Features:•	a list of all the NSO activities with locations and times (if app was live, this would be administrated and updated daily as needed) (GOAL)•	a subsection where users can add contact information for their NSO leaders and members of their NSO group to have on hand (GOAL)•	another subsection to add general contacts that they meet throughout their experience (GOAL)•	a section to add professor contact info to have on hand (GOAL)•	a scheduler so students can schedule their classes and NSO events and have a reminder function that displays an alert at a chosen time •	a campus map to help first time visitors get acquainted (GOAL)•	a menu to the wave (GOAL)•	gym hours (GOAL)•	library hours (GOAL)•	other miscellaneous university information (GOAL)The main screen when the application loads will present a user with a NSO themed view and a TabBarController to make a selection. 4 tabs will be used to navigate this application, similar to the way the Facebook application works now that it has recently been updated.4 tabbed features:	Event Schedule:•	easy to read schedule with a list of NSO events, locations, and timesContacts•	an area for students to store contact information about their NSO leaders, NSO team mates, general friends they meet, and professors•	this will be an editable list with different sub views for each type accessed by a UITableView(NSO, general contacts, professors)•	users will be able to add, delete, edit, move•	it will have a navigation controller so they can get back to the main info page where they can select the type of info they requireEvent Scheduler•	this will be the most challenging aspect we reckon•	allows a user to enter an event (ie a class, or a NSO event) and will be able to choose the date and time of the event and when they would like the notification•	users can view, edit, delete, or add an event•	allow users to sort alphabetically or manually mange contacts•	it will have a navigation controller so they can get back to the main info page where they can select the type of info they requireCampus Info•	general info section that will allow a user to press a button for library, gym, wave, etc… info•	it will have a navigation controller so they can get back to the main info page where they can select the type of info they requireTentative Project Schedule:Week 1: Oct 27 – Nov 2•	layout set up•	campus info tab complete•	NSO welcome page complete•	NSO Events page completeWeek 2: Nov 3 – Nov 9•	Screen 2 contacts completeWeek 3: Nov 10 – Nov 16•	Determine where we are at with event schedule and determine if it is a feasible option•	Debug and final testingNo major concerns at this point. We will try and implement most of the features we have learned in class while researching and implementing other aspects as well. Obviously, this is a mockup and the way it navigates will likely change, but it is great to have our ideas on paper in front of us. *Note: We will populate with current information about UPEI but will use NSO 2012 info for events and locations for a practical demonstration.
